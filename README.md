# TournamentTracker
Welcome, this project is called the **Tournament Tracker**.<br>
It is mainly for fighting games and based around my experience
of the super smash bros melee streams and tournament. For those that want to
stream their small tournaments or easily change something on their stream without the hassle of
going into obs or your favorite live stream software then tideously changing player names and also wins per side.
